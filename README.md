# Angular Todos list

An excercise in buiding an app with [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/) which started with a tutorial for beginners on the AngularJS homepage.

This app currently does the following:

- Uses `localStorage` to store data if supported by the browser
- Creates a todo's list that can be checked off when done
- Stores the checked items in the 'done pile' until removed or restored to the todo's list
